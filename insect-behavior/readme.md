# insect behavior

I was messing around with insect behavior to see what types of patterns can be learned from them. I'll see what comes up with these three for now.

- analyze flies for their behaviors
- - flies are interesting for their ability to be attracted to certain scents (Is it scent molecules that they detect?)

- analyze ants for their behavior
- - specifically, with ants, I'm curious of their sorting abilities when it comes to devouring large prey and then carrying food back to their nest
- - when ants fight other predators, do they engage in "sorting behavior" to attack?
