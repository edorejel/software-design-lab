# Test Cases

Some test cases to use on the Basic AI System. The test cases shall help me make adjustments to the system.


### test cases to use on the artificial intelligence system

1. __poisoning the well:__ https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well

- poisoning the well falls under gossip 
- poisoning the well can also fall under spite

- "The usual method is to point out the unpleasant nature of the person making the opposing argument, in which case it is a special case of a personal attack or ad hominem. In general, "to poison the well" means to pre-provide any information that could produce a biased opinion of the reasoning, positive or negative." 

- __Author notes:__ Most of the time, with poisoning the well arguments,
the world could have lived better without an attempt to poison the well, that is, provide gossip. Poisoning the well can
also be done out of spite. Thus, with "poisoning the well" arguments, you will not only attempt to influence the mind of someone with your belief, but you will also be judged for revealing the belief. The judgement could be good or bad.

- __Spite and gossip__ have now been covered by the logical reasoning fallacy called "poisoning the well". It looks like my artificial intelligence system could be able to reason, but this is still too preliminary to consider.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
####  Possible new modules to address gossip (poisoning the well type beliefs) 
- __Did you or the source inform the intended target about whom the belief/gossip is about? Would there be consequences if you informed the intended target?__ If the answer to the first question is negative, I would be suspect about the claims being presented. If the answer to the second question is positive, I would be suspect about the claims being presented.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- __What is the relation of your source to the intended target?__
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- __What is the point of bringing up this information now? What do you have to gain?__ This third one might already be answered.
The motivation for bringing up the information/belief now, excluding other motivations, is going to fall back to spite. Examining the cause of the spite might be out of scope for the Basic AI system. I don't think Basic AI systems could or should be able to explain the cause of a subjective belief in an entity that is supposed to posses critical thinking faculties, unless the AI system is attached in a functioning form to access the human-mind component of the entity.

- If you ask a person the questions above, and there is no financial element to be gained from their response, then the motivation for bringing up information that is not relevant, but only serves to poison the well, is going to settle on spite with other subjective elements closely tied to spite. These elements could be the greater good, or something similar. The greater good is a subjective element. Another subjective element is the welfare and safety of so-and-so group. This element can be objective, so when this reasoning element is used to justify something, it should be examined closely. 

#### Situation Involving the Greater Good Mentality

> doughnut vs donut (thank you) https://www.grammar.com/donut_vs._doughnut

- Person A: I'm going to walk into a doughnut shop and eat all the doughnuts.
- Person B: Are you going to pay the shop money for all the doughnuts you plan to eat?
- Person A: No. I'm just going to walk into the shop to eat all the doughnuts without paying.
- Person B: Why would you do that?
- Person A: Because doughnuts are unhealthy. If I eat all of them, I can prevent people from eating unhealthy food. I'm doing it for the greater good of society. Think of all the children I can help.

- __Absurd argument above:__ The argument above is absured.  Unless someone is actually objectively acting on behalf of the greater good, for example, doing something heroic, I would be suspect about that particular claim being made. Further, it is not wrong to ask a person what they have to gain by their actions, if their actions are not necessarily relevant to a situation.

"Think of the greater good" is often used to justify things that are illegal, but without a victim. The person justifies their illegal actions
by stating that they are acting on behalf of the greater good. The greater good the person is referencing probably does not exist. There definitely are subjective ulterior motives that would compel a person to justify illegal behavior in the name of the greater good. __Most of the time, there is no such thing as a victimless crime or a harmless illegal activity.__


- __Another way of thinking about "poisoning the well":__ 
- Person A says something that is out of the blue, about Person B's future wife.
- Person A says Person B's future wife is unattractive, and she'll only get more unattractive as she ages.
- Person B is madly in love with his wife. Person B doesn't care about Person A's opinion.
- Person B accepts her regardless of her appearance to Person A.
- Person B responds to Person A by questioning his actions.
- Person B responds by stating, "Bro, seriously? Are you pulling this stunt now?"

There is no financial gain by Person A. Person A's actions were more than likely done for nefarious reasons. Person A is just being a 
mean person.

There are other examples not as explicit as the one I used. People of various backgrounds and education levels can be spiteful in their own subtle ways. However, __if the spite is obvious AND there is no visible financial gain evident__, there might be 
some deeper meaning in the spiteful behavior.

2. __self-fulling prophecy:__ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy

- Self-fulfilling prophecy refers to the socio-psychological phenomenon of someone "predicting" or expecting something, and this “prediction” or expectation comes true simply because one believes it will,[1] and their resulting behaviors align to fulfil those beliefs. This suggests peoples' beliefs influence their actions. The principle behind this phenomenon is people create consequences regarding people or events, based on their previous knowledge toward that specific subject. Additionally, self-fulfilling prophecy is applicable to negative and positive outcomes."

- __Self-fulling prophecy__ may also be covered by my artificial intelligence system wherein one is personally invested in a belief. The system does have a module for being personally invested in a belief. 


- __Easily understood like this:__ If you think bad, then bad's what you get.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- __Author notes:__ the two cases above appear to be covered by the AI system found here. This is good considering I am designing this thing from scratch. The AI system is not complete, but test cases can now be analyzed to improve the system if required. 
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. __driving behavior:__ a language is a form of communication with a set of rules, the rules can be altered wherein many versions of the language can coexist with the first version of the language, then, we can assume that a language for driving also exists within the realm of human spoken languages, further, the driving language can be altered to accommodate many languages, that is, a driver fluent in chinese only, will have the ability to understand and communicate in "driving language" because the driving language exists as long as humans posses the ability to drive a car
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- there might be something more going on in the human-mind when driving a vehicle than just driving, maybe the primitive mind is playing a role
- brain scans of F1 drivers or other race car drivers during a race would help
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- __the act of driving can also be analyzed from a reasoning perspective__ the goal of this is to then examine the various decisions a driver or driverless car can make. Test case to use is from personal experience of reaching a crowded intersection, trying to make a left turn on the crowded intersection, but the flow of traffic is going right. It is also rush-hour, so there will be many cars traveling in the right direction. 
- The goal is to understand the communication and decision-making mechanisms involved in __trying__ to make the left turn at this busy intersection. It was me that was trying to make the left turn. Left turns can be inefficient when driving at certain times. When driving at certain times, it is ideal to structure your driving route with right turns when required, or avoiding left turns altogether.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Adding a fourth test that should be accommodated by the AI system here.

4. __Psychological reactance__ "an unpleasant motivational arousal that emerges when people experience a threat to or loss of their free behaviors." 
- "Reactance theory assumes there are "free behaviors" individuals perceive and can take part in at any given moment." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)

- __Author notes:__ Reactance theory can be controversial along with psychology and other social sciences. I think it can still be covered by the artificial intelligence system found here. Reactance theory itself may fall victim to a logical reasoning fallacy depending on the behavior involved. Actually, I think Reactance theory will fall victim to logical reasoning fallacies.

- __Easily understood like this:__ If you take away the bear's honey, there's going to be consequences.
- __Easily understood with this phrase:__ F_ck you! I won't do what you tell me.
- __important:__ do not assign gender to the bear
- __Streisand Effect:__ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Adding a fifth test case (The Runner, The Sprinter, The Jumper, The Mindset)
5. __Ingrained evolutionary patterns of behavior__ The act of running or sprinting forces the human-mind to concentrate on the actual task itself, thereby removing the possibility of thinking about another task. The mind appears to have ingrained the pattern of behavior that when humans run (or sprint), the mind shall focus on the task being performed. If the human-mind thinks to run faster, the body shall follow until no longer feasible. 

#### Testing grammar phrases for the Basic AI system shall be: 
- As I am seated in my chair, I am running fast.
- As I run fast, I am thinking I am running slow.
- As I sprint fast, I think I am a slow sprinter.
- I am sprinting very fast, while thinking I want to sprint slow. <--- this might be impossible to do, if it is possible, it will feel weird, and the sprinting should feel unnatural because I think that sprinting is something that humans have ingrained in the survival areas of the human brain, and it is something that humans can do naturally until no longer possible

- I will sprint slow, while thinking that I am sprinting fast. <--- this might be impossible to do, if done, it will feel weird and unnatural, if you are sprinting slow, I don't think you are really sprinting, possibly jogging, not even running, but jogging

- - Sprinting is an interesting human activity because when I sprint, I don't think to myself, "I will go faster soon, I am running at a steady pace now, but soon, I will feel like sprinting to finish my workout, so I should be ready to sprint." I do, however, think to myself, "Time to sprint!" So I set a target distance and just start sprinting until I get tired.

- I command my body to sprint fast, while I think of sprinting slow. <--- this might be impossible to do
- I command my body to jump forward, while I think of jumping backwards. <--- this might be impossible to do
- I command my body to jump backward, while I think of jumping forward. <--- this might be impossible to do
- I command my body to jump straight up, while I think of jumping forward. <--- this might be impossible to do
- I command my body to run forward, while I think of running backwards. <--- this might be impossible to do
