# Spiders

Examining spider behavior for potential applications.


Spider Algorithm for choosing multiple valuable targets. 

- I saw a spider display some unique behavior.
- The spider had to make a choice between catching prey or defending itself and its prey from another spider.
- The spider I observed was smaller in size than the one trying to attack it or take its prey.
- The behavior displayed by the spider can be considered a Spider algorithm.
- The smaller spider did manage to escape and capture its prey, but it did so in a strategic manner.
- The spider might have been applying the Bellman-Ford Algorithm in its decision making process, but with a modification to it.
- The modification appeared to be a priority queue, but the priority queue was also modified from the traditional priority queue.
- analyze spider movements for their behavior
- - for spiders, analyze spiders for their predatory movements when pursuing prey and when competing for prey again other spiders
