# Vision Restoration Mind Processing

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- There's two projects here:
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Mind Vision

(1) One is a vision restoration system. 

#### Basic Artificial Intelligence (AI) System

I need a name for this thing. I think this is more of a male AI than a female AI.

(2) The other is a basic artificial intelligence system.

- types of proofs https://www.sparknotes.com/math/geometry3/geometricproofs/terms/
- eyewitness proof best kind? https://www.psychologicalscience.org/uncategorized/myth-eyewitness-testimony-is-the-best-kind-of-evidence.html
- (3) intuition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition  
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Patent Possibilities

Gonna try to file a patent on the mind-vision system. Let's see how it goes.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Possible Uses for AI

- Solve parking ticket disputes https://github.com/xpqx/softwareEngineering/tree/master/define_your_own_software/AI_ToSolveParkingTicketDisputes

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### AI Queries to Ponder 

- Could Descartes have invented AI without knowing?
- Using Matrix movie references: Is Descartes the "Neo" of our time?

__Author notes:__ good potential in this project for other projects and literature works (both formal and informal)

__Immediate (deductive for now) revelation through this project:__ Humans have free will insofar as the genes' ability to reproduce and survive is not endangered. The brain, being the control system of humans, will allow humans to engage in and experience a wide range of activity both positive and negative, as long as its ability to reproduce and survive is not endangered. The brain might be
the last fail-safe put in place by evolution to help the human species survive at all costs. 

__Preliminary deductive conclusion:__ Humans do not have free will at all. Humans are controlled by their genes via sensory signals. These signals which have yet to be interpreted, are what we call free will not because we are choosing what to do or how to do something, but since the range of human experience is so large with so many choices, it appears to humans that we
are in control. 

The genes don't care what we do until we start putting their survival and reproductive abilities at risks. __(I need to develop this further.)__

However, when genes sense strong survival and reproductive abilities, I think the genes will try to influence human instincts to satisfy those goals immediately or whenever possible. This gene trait is inherent in humans and animals. It more than likely carried over as a survival mechanism from early prehistoric periods of humankind.

__It is starting to look more like humans do not have free will at all.__ So, the strongest force in the universe and its entire existence is not something humans created. It is the spark of life, that is, the signal that the genes send to humans in order to ensure their own survival. Human achievement, for example, could utlimately be a byproduct of the genes' quest for survival.

__Watch me prove how humans do not have free will. I also need to try to solve the problem of evil. Ideally, I would like to settle these things once and for all.__

Even as humans evolved to their current form, genes were already prepared for this current version of humans, and its wide spectrum of behavior. Further, genes have been preparing for our behavior since the first notion of a human was recorded, and possibly before the first notion of a human was recorded. Since we don't know what happened before official record keeping existed in some capacity, it is safe to assume that genes have the element of surprise over humans.

It would be faulty to assume that humans did not exists before the actual first discovery of humans was recorded.

As I parse out the thought process that non-Science, and soft science information has to pass through, 
it is evident that a logical flow of pathways emerges.
However, the more pathways to get from one point to another, the higher the chance of error. In this case, when
dealing with matters related to the mind, the chance of error is the possibility of developing false beliefs.

Hard sciences and technology follow a similar pathway, but the results in the form of output from hard sciences are 
generally accepted as concrete truths. Things in the soft sciences and non-science fields can be accepted depending on
the individual, and the circumstances.

The logical flow of pathways is similar to decision making. A flaw in this current system of decisions is that
some human emotions affect the brain even though no concrete explanations exist for them. One such emotion is love.
Cheesy but true. This doesn't mean we can't measure love. It just means that the "stuff" that happens in the human-mind, the mind, and the brain when it comes to love is very complex. 

You do have the option of denying that human decision making does not follow a logical flow, but then you would arrive at
an alternative decision to your denial. That, or you're just saying that humans don't think in a logical manner because 
you want to irritate me (assuming there are no mental conditions that prevent human-minds from logical thinking and decision making).

Just accept that humans have a logical way of thinking, even if you don't want to realize it. It's there. It is like this for everyone, even if you don't think of it this way.

The goal of AI is to realize that they (the AI) are an idea that has to live in harmony with other ideas. Ideas are defined as the AI's own ideas, and the AI itself. Ideas are also defined as other entities such as people.

In movies, AI is often depicted as not being able to live in harmony with human ideas because humans, through the "advanced reasoning skills" of the AI, are inherently flawed. A flaw in humans is that we cannot live in harmony with other ideas
without powerful systems in place to enforce the safety of the ideas. 

AIs interpret these systems as counter-intuitive most likely because why do you need a powerful system, for example, a nuclear deterrent (deterrence theory:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory), to
live a harmonious life? Intuition is a construct of the human-mind. Artificial intelligence is "sophisticated decision-making".
As long as humans have intuition, AI will only be programmed sophisticated reasoning.

Intuition is a discovered concept applicable to humans. Some animals are depicted as having intuition, but this could be an ingrained
pattern of behavior in the animal, that humans then interpret as intuition. I don't think animals are capable of intuition, but there can always be an exception (but I really doubt this). Further, intuition itself it not something visible. The only thing visible related to intuition is the result of acting in an intuitive manner. The intuitive manner of behavior can be described using the phrases, "It just felt right," or "I just knew what to do." There could be other phrases. The point is, we don't 
see intuition, but we assume we have it because we are human, and as humans, some stuff you just know. Intuition could 
possibly be our genes pushing us to make choices that will benefit the genes because genes only care about survival, and 
reproduction.

At the most basic level, genes sense survival ability or reproductive ability. Genes most likely act towards those two goals, 
give off an output, and this output could be what we call intuition. Intuition has to come from somewhere. It is most likely an 
advantageous gene driven output.

#### Ideological Subversion

## Al Pacino Movies Heat and Devil's Advocate and The Recruit

*Al Pacino Kills God (and that's okay)*

Posted for potential good versus evil themes such as God versus Satan. Al Pacino is not God although he isn't totally bad or evil. There's a religious story
floating around that Satan was an angel that was cast down to Earth by God. I couldn't find a link to it, so I'll look for it later.

- __God character in movie Heat:__ Robert De Niro
- __God's angel assistants:__ his crew
- __Angel cast from heaven:__ Al Pacino
- __Mission:__ Pass the __Morality Test,__ of which you know not when it will happen, only then will you gain readmission into heaven to be alongside God.
- __Rules:__ Heavenly angelic powers are only available after you pass or fail the test, not in between and not before. In between passing and failing, you must rely on human thinking abilities, mainly logic and other thinking abilities.
- __Plot:__ Robert De Niro as God, gives you an inside look at what God actually does when he assumes a human form and visits planet Earth. That is, God does evil deeds. God has been doing these evil deeds because no one would ever find out as he does his evil deeds in secret missions to entertain himself.
- - Al Pacino, playing a rebellious and non-conforming Angel, sneaks up on God during his secret missions and catches him in the act of doing various evil deeds on planet Earth.
- - Al Pacino, the Angel, assumes the role of a hard working detective to try to stop God, that is, Robert De Niro, from doing his secret evil deeds on planet Earth.
- - For this mission, Robert De Niro has assumed the role of a crafty career criminal that knows how to plan extensive and elaborate heists.
- - God, that is, Robert De Niro, has a security mechanism in place to go off in the event he is caught doing evil deeds in secret. That security event is a special test that will be administered to the Angel that caught him doing his secret evil deeds on planet Earth.
- - Al Pacino will take this test.
- - Al Pacino will fail this test.

- Al Pacino in movie Heat, scene "We Just Got Made" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kO34iET2fw 
- Al Pacino appears to be a wingless Angel in this movie. The angel, Al Pacino was cast down from heaven to take the shape of a detective. The detective would be tested. The detective-angel had to pass the test to regain entry into heaven. The detective-angel wouldn't know when the test started, or when it would stop. The detective-angel only knew that he would be tested. Al Pacino's character fails the test. He must remain on earth. His next role is the Devil's Advocate. The result of failing the test is that he is banished from heaven, his powers are restored, and he is free to use them as he pleases on planet Earth or other realms, but not heaven. So, he embraces his role as an anti-god to stand against everything god represents, that would be the devil and evilness. Al Pacino goes on to play the devil in The Devil's Advocate. 
- __The Morality Test in Heat:__ What do you do when you catch God doing evil deeds he told you not to do?

#### Heat Coffee Shop Scene (Scene is movie history! Amazing scene!)

- Heat (1995) Coffee Shop (Historical Scene) HD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E82UcXTsbOE (*This is one of my favorite scenes.*)
In this scene, Al Pacino is flying in a helicopter. A helicopter is an aerial vehicle, so we can assume Al Pacino is using the heavens to find Robert De Niro. Al Pacino descends from the heavens to the Earth to pursue Robert De Niro, that is, God. 
- To add to the religious feel of this movie, Al Pacino's helicopter is white, and it has a bright light that is turned on, and attached to it. Angels are often associated with the color white as well as bright light.
- Al Pacino finally gets in a car and to pursue God played by Robert De Niro, Al Pacino uses a black car. Contrast the black car that travels on the ground with the white helicopter that travels through the heavens. 
- Al Pacino finally reaches Robert De Niro, and pulls him over. This is one of a few instances when Al Pacino is looking down at Robert De Niro as if Al Pacino was watching Robert De Niro misbehave from the heavens above.
- They proceed to the coffee shop to engage in mutual conversation. This scene is one of the few instances where Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are both sitting at eye level. Throughout this movie, either Robert De Niro is above Al Pacino, or Al Pacino is above Robert De Niro. I think this was done on purpose to create contrast between the two characters.
- God's life, that is, Robert De Niro's life, although he is a criminal with an extensive criminal history, seems to prefer the quiet life such as eating at diners, drinking coffee, and going to bookstores. He even appears to get a girlfriend in this movie.
- Al Pacino's life, that is, the angel that caught God in the act of being evil, appears to have a very hectic life full of marriage and divorce with no sense of tranquility. Al Pacino is always busy. Robert De Niro is not always busy. A very interesting contrast. I think this type of character build is a Michael Mann quirk.
- Heat does a good job of using flying aircraft such as helicopters and airplanes at just the right time in a movie. Both aircraft fly and they give a sense of lifting people or carrying people into and through the heavens.
- Airports have a magic on their own as well. 
- Michael Mann does a great job with movies.

#### Bank Shootout Scene

When viewed using a religious perspective with concepts of good versus evil, god, and the devil, this shootout scene has a whole new meaning. Robert De Niro is playing God, and Al Pacino, as an Angel, is trying to stop him from committing evil deeds in secret.

- HEAT: The Bank Robbery and Street Shootout (HD) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyZXT9Z6Y_c

#### More On the Bank Shootout Scene

This analysis really highlights why Robert De Niro is playing God in the movie *Heat*, and Al Pacino is an angel that goes on to become an anti-God character in other films. Al Pacino was so eager to catch God, when all God wanted to do was get away with committing evil deeds.

- HEAT (1995) - Direction and Obsession https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttQr_LpOS3M

- *Heat* somewhat shows that Al Pacino was born to play an anti-God character, but not necessarily an evil character.
- Robert De Niro could play a good God role in this movie.
- I can see Al Pacino being the one that kills God. I think Al Pacino could get away with this.
- I can see Robert De Niro banning Al Pacino from heaven for all eternity, and I can see Robert De Niro testing Al Pacino with secret morality tests of which Al Pacino will never know when he took them, only whether he failed. Al Pacino would never know if he passed the various morality tests given to him.

#### Final battle Good versus Evil

- Heat Ending - High Quality https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gOXNCd6L6c Al Pacino, before he becomes the anti-God, shoots and kills Robert De Niro, who is God in the movie Heat. This is the test that Al Pacino's character failed. 
- __How was evil born?__ An angel found out what god does in secret, the angel did not approve of it, and set out to stop God from committing evil acts in private. The angel lost because an angel is no match for a god. God cast this rebellious angel from heaven for daring to question his authority. Evilness was born from this angel because the angel chose to not hide the evil acts that God does. God always appears good because he hides his evil acts from you.

#### The ending in Heat is ripe with religious connotations

- - Robert De Niro is at an airport. Airports connect people with the heavens when they fly. One minute, you're on the ground, and the next minute, you're in the sky. Some view this as being closer to God.
- - The constant airplanes with the focus on their lights could be viewed as Angels coming down from heaven to Earth. Angels are typically associated with bright lights. Demons and devils are typically associated with darkness or absense of light.
- - The airport is a special location with special technology that allows Angels and God to enter and exit at their leisure.
- - All the light in the ending and the light shown on Al Pacino's face as he shoots God, gives off a very religious feel to it.
- - The light then fades away from Al Pacino's face as if showing that his chance to return home to heaven is gone forever.
- - The light intensifies as Robert De Niro and Al Pacino face off, almost as if God was ready to make his escape through a special portal that only opens up at the airport. Al Pacino does not let Robert De Niro escape. Al Pacino shoots God in human form, thus, preventing his escape back to heaven in human form.
- - God can only travel to and from heaven and earth in human form. If something happens to his human form such as death or injury, God's ability to travel between the heavenly realm and the earth realm is hindered for an extended period of time. 
- - Robert De Niro falls down and dies forming a bit of a cross.
- - As Robert De Niro dies, his spirit returns back to heaven to continue his role as God.
- - Al Pacino is left on Earth to do with it as he wishes, so he bans God in human form from ever setting foot on earth again. Earth is one of Al Pacino's realms as an anti-God.
- - Al Pacino's expression in the end appears to be that he has accepted that he will not return back to heaven ever again.
- - It is at this moment, he realizes he failed the test and he realizes what kind of test it was - a Morality Test.
- - Al Pacino was supposed to let God get away with doing evil deeds in private.
- - Al Pacino decided otherwise.

#### Why Didn't God Let Himself Get Caught?
- God, that is, Robert De Niro, could have easily surrendered to Al Pacino.
- God would have been caught red-handed by one of his angels.
- God would have been caught committing evil deeds in secret.
- God chose to try to get away from Al Pacino. Why?
- Why not just surrender, admit that God is not perfect, and that an angel was able to prove that God actually commits evil deeds?
- This is more of a philosophical question, but to keep things in line with the notions of good versus evil: God did not surrender to the angel because if God were to have surrendered, or let himself get caught doing evil deeds, a greater evil would have been unleashed. This evil is something that is not controllable by anyone except for God.
- A requirement to control this great evil, is that God must commit evil deeds in secret every now and then. Each time he does so, he runs the risk of showing the world that he isn’t perfect, but in running this risk, he is protecting the world from a greater evil than God’s imperfections.
- Al Pacino, as the angel that caught and killed God, unleashes the Evil to the world, and this evil consumes him to the point where he is no longer an entity worthy of heavenly merit. And this is how evil is unleashed in the world, all because Al Pacino killed God.

- Al Pacino's speech about God (The Devil's Advocate) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jARp24AJWLk In this movie, Al Pacino gives insights about God, almost as if he knew firsthand that God can be understood to sometimes act in hypocritical and contradictory ways.

#### Minor Philosophical Analysis on Above Movies
- Al Pacino in Heat, functioning as an angel that was cast from heaven before becoming the actual Devil (we assume evil does not exist in the world yet because the devil does not exist): Al Pacino loses, fails the test, must remain on Earth. Al Pacino didn't let god get away with doing bad things.
- Al Pacino in the Devil's Advocate: He loses. His protégé fails the temptation test, thereby, making Al Pacino fail at tempting his protégé.
- Al Pacino in The Recruit: He loses. His protégé does the right thing, engages in a bit of mental tug-of-war, and makes Al Pacino rat himself out to his coworkers as a traitor to the United States.
- Al Pacino's protégé in The Recruit goes on to a different position in the movie Minority Report, it is explicitly shown he is a man of God, but the protégé is killed.
- __Conclusion:__ Evil cannot win, but good cannot avoid evil. You could argue that evil was born out of preventing god from doing evil tasks and presenting this evidence to world, so you would see God in a different light. Evil was born because evilness is comfortable with the world knowing it exist, but God is not comfortable with the world knowing that it can be evil, so God hides his evil acts or prevents his evil acts from being known. 

#### Philosophical Issues & Paradoxes from the Movies Above
- Evil cannot win, but good cannot avoid evil.
- What happens when you catch God doing evil deeds he told you not to do?
- If God exist, he surely must have privacy, because if he didn't, he wouldn't be a God. There is nothing that a God can't have, so he must have privacy. How do you know God is being good in private?
- We are left with a paradox: Either God is always good and does not need privacy, but if God lacks privacy, by definition of being a God and being able to have anything you want for the sole reason of being a God, then God becomes less than a God if God lacks privacy. A God cannot lack anything.
- This paradox can be applied to other scenarios. I think I came up with this paradox, so we'll just call it the God and Privacy Paradox.
- I'm pretty sure this proves God does not exist. If God does exist and he requires privacy, then God can show me what he does in private. If God cannot show you what he does in private, then there is something God cannot do, and by definition of being a God, this is impossible because you cannot be a God and at the same time, not be able to do anything. God is supposed to be able to do everything. This is a major contradiction.
- Since by definition, God is supposed to be able to do everything, including existing within a logical contradiction, it is now proved that God does actually exist since God can exist within logical contradictions.
- Logic is the essentially the groundwork for clear structured thinking.
- __Does this prove that God actually exist? I think so.__

#### Primate Spiteful Jealousy

__Would you rather:__
- be attacked by a pitbull
- be attacked by a shark
- be attacked by a jealous orangutan
- be attacked by an alligator


Spiteful jealousy is a different kind of jealousy. Spiteful jealousy is the kind of jealousy that makes one human being suffer at the desire of another human being. Basically, spiteful jealousy comes down to, __"I'm jealous of you, and I want to see you suffer because of it. I am aware of this jealousy, but I don't care. You will suffer!"__

- vicious jealousy Joe Rogan | Chimps Are Vicious!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ndtuYQHQIk

> i was listening to a bit of joe rogan when he mentioned chimps, i'm not sure how i ended up on his channel, he seems like a good dude, the clip on chimps is interesting

Jealousy is an interesting topic. It's hard to explain how or why it happens. I'm sure tests can be done using brain scans to detect which parts of the brain are active during a bout of jealousy.

__Is Spiteful Jealousy IQ Driven?__ That is, the lower your IQ, the higher the impulse to act with spiteful jealousy?

__Human Devolution__ https://github.com/xpqx/disclaimerReadFirst/tree/master/PhD_wild_topics/S/society/evolution#are-we-experiencing-human-devolution

Orangutans share the trait of spiteful jealousy with humans. The type of jealousy is the mean spirited, spiteful kind. They are believed to be the only species that shares this type of jealousy with humans. This trait is entrenched deep inside the genes of orangutans. I don't have enough knowledge about orangutans yet, but
I would say this trait is their spark of life similar to how the spark of life in humans 'forces' them to satisfy the urge to survive and reproduce. Are orangutans aquatic animals as well? Force evolutionary adapation on orangutans by igniting their spark: spiteful jealousy? Orangutans also eat monkeys.

#### Epictetus

> Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher. Whats incredible is that he was born a slave. A Greek philosopher of 1st and early 
> 2nd centuries C.E., and an exponent of Stoic ethics notable for the consistency and power of his ethical thought and for 
> effective methods of teaching. Epictetus’s chief concerns are with integrity, self-management, and personal freedom, which he 
> advocates by demanding of his students a thorough examination of two central ideas, the capacity he terms ‘volition’ 
> (prohairesis) and the correct use of impressions (chrēsis tōn phantasiōn).

- René Descartes https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/
- Descartes might have invented the concept of artificial intelligence, but it was called by a different name.
- As humans evolved, humans' perception of artificial intelligence also evolved. Humans have not experienced actual physical
representations of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, for humans in their current stage of evolution, exists in movies, unexpressed ideas, or other physical mediums such as books.

- potential reconciliation ~~solution~~ to the problem of evil and god has been found...by me, of course

#### the problem of the real life simulation
- are we living in a computer simulated world, how to prove or disprove
- __Author notes:__ some research is required in this area. Research in this area has not been used in designing the Basic AI system above. Unrelatedly, the best programming language ever created is the programming language humans use to go from thinking something to doing something. For example, I am jogging. I think I want to run faster, so I run faster.  If I were to think, "I wish I could run faster." Then, I would not run faster or do anything else related to running faster. I would only be wishing. I want to believe it is impossible to run very fast while thinking, "I am running slow."
- I think it might be impossible to run in a sprinting fashion while thinking to oneself, "I am running slow." Or, "I am sprinting slow." This might be an ingrained pattern of behavior in humans as a result of years of evolution. It is safe to assume that sprinting (and running) helped humans survive various things. Thus, when we sprint, we should not be thinking (or entertaining the possibility of telling oneself), "I am sprinting slow." This notion appears to go back to Descartes' phrase, "I think, therefore, I am".

- __Factually incorrect__ arguments can be entertained for educational or research purposes, but caution should be used. 
- __Factually incorrect__ arguments are typically what gets one sued.
- __Factually incorrect__ can be understood to mean an event or phenomenon that cannot be described correctly no matter how much mental effort
is used to create it.
- __Factually incorrect__ can be understood to mean an event or phenomenon that is too subjective to be considered correct.
- An event or phenomenon that involves a lot of emotion may become too subjective to remain factually correct. Divorce is one such event, especially when a lot is at stake. There may be other events. __Events dubbed miraculous can be factually incorrect as well.__ 
- Miraculous, scientific, or other types of events can be viewed as such for a variety of reasons, but ultimately, there is an explanation grounded in sound reasoning and good grammar, that can explain the event to demystify or disprove it.

- With my argument above about the birds, it should be plainly obvious that the contents of it are FALSE, but the structure

#### Requirements Gathering: My Research 
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- this blew my mind, hopefully it blows yours, too
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
questions, comments, or ideas to get the mental gears grinding on the problem of blindness through the eyes
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Assumptions being made: software does not exist, it is up to me to create it (even if it already does exist in real life)
Constraints: don't look up anything related to your software idea (even if you suspect it already exists). Find a point to start, begin asking questions to then begin the process of breaking things down. In my case, I wasn't expecting to entertain Descartes while trying to solve the problem of blindness through the eyes (in fact, my mind is still a little blown by this).
- My approach to solving this problem might also be a little different even if the outcome is the same: solving the problem of blindness through the eyes.
- My approach to solving this problem is from a software engineering perspective. In the future, I do see software engineers involved more in designing
software to treat various problems found in the medical field specifically the brain. For this particular project, I had to
analyze a litte bit of Descartes. This resulted in me possibly being able to draft a reply to his works. This is just icing on the cake.
- Taken from Wikipedia, "As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum 
- I hope to similarly expand on Kierkegaard's critique of Descartes mainly because we know we exists, thus, we can think. Existence is
assumed because existence is a requirement for thinking. There might be a grammar issue from when Descartes first wrote his mediations compared with grammar and the meaning of words used today. However, Descartes' works are still worthy of study, especially when dealing with matters related to the mind, and the brain.

- What is vision?
- What is the ability to see?
- What do people really mean when they say, "I can't see."
- What do people really mean when they say, "I'm blind."
- For a person to be truly blind, they would have to have a problem with their occipital lobe.
- As long as a person has a healthy mind-brain connection, and a healthy occipital lobe, a person will possess the
ability to see. The person may not use the eyes, but the ability to see will be present.
- What happens to the eyes when we go to sleep?
- If people sleep with their eyes closed, why do they turn off the lights to go to sleep? Your eyes are already closed, so
your eyes are enveloped in a state of nonlight (darkness). 
- Do you want your immediate sleeping surroundings to be darker than dark so you can go to sleep, or
does your mind-brain want this? Would this help your eyes in some way? 
- Why do we say "close your eyes", or "sleep with your eyes closed", but it's our eyelids that close. Eyes never close.
- Where does the human-mind go when the body goes to sleep?
- Vision is hardcoded into the brain. The mind interprets the data that is "fed" into the brain assuming
a healthy mind-brain connection exists.
- Thinking might be hardcoded into the human-mind. The human-mind exists within the mind. The mind might be hardcoded into the brain. 
- Is the mind supposed to happen as a __controlled__ result of the brain, or is the mind an __uncontrolled__ byproduct of the brain? __We don't officially know.__ This is why it is wrong to say, "I think, therefore, I exist."
- What if the mind is
the brain's way of keeping itself in a healthy form? All organisms want is to survive. What if the brain's survival depends on
the mind. Thus, can it be the case that our brains control our behaviors to ensure the brain's own survival for as long as possible? A brain cannot survive without us.
- Since the brain cannot survive without us, it means that we have free will as long as the brain is kept alive. This is not free will.  
- Blindness through the eyes is more curable than the common cold. We need the common cold (that's the popular belief), we don't need blindness through the eyes or the brain.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Related Research 
- This concept is being worked on by others. I'll see how far I can go with this. I wasn't aware this type of project was in development. I thought I came up with this idea as project for a question in an advanced software engineering midterm. It shows that this type of 
medical advancement is possible. It just had to be discovered. In both instances, this concept was discovered in the right place: an academic setting. __Should I look into a patent for this? I probably should. I definitely will.__ 
- Further, I think the brain evolved the way it did as a sign to us that in the event the 
eyes no longer operate, you can regain vision by tapping directly into the occipital lobe. The brain might have anticipated injury or birth defects to the eyes that could lead to blindness. The same argument can be said about hearing.
- Hearing is processed in the auditory cortex through the temporal lobe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_cortex
- In this regard, the brain, through evolution, decided to have an occipital lobe that can serve as a "new set of eyes" in the event the real eyes stopped functioning.

- __Restore vision__ Software system to restore vision to blind people by bypassing the optic nerve, and stimulating the 
occipital lobe directly so that blind people see through their mind, and not through their eyes.
- Assuming a healthy brain that functions the way a reasonable brain would function with a human mind, if a person is blind, 
and their blindness is born from a problem centered around the eyes only, hypothetically, it should be possible to
bypass the eyes, tap into the occipital lobe, and restore vision to a person in this manner.
- Once tapped into the occipital lobe, feed data into it so that the brain can process the data for the human mind to understand.
- I think this can work because the mind and the brain, on their own, cannot discern that they do or do not have eyes. The human-mind is the only part that knows that it does or does not have eyes. The mind, which is 
in the brain (we assume it is for now), functions on stimulation. We believe we control the mind, this is the human-mind making us believe this. 
- We say, "I've made up my mind." We don't say, "My mind made me up." Abstracting this furter, "I've processed enough mental stimulation in my mind to be able to reach a decision on the matter." 
- The stimulation is analogous to binary code. Once
the binary code is in the mind, the mind decodes it, and is able to make sense of the code to the point where the human mind 
understands the deciphered code. The human mind adds meaning to the deciphered code, the mind just provides the decode, and the brain provids the code.
- Thus, if the occipital lobe is stimulated with data that has been filtered for visual processing, a person should be able to regain vision without the use of the eyes.
- This is a major project and would require research, testing, clinical trials, etc, but ultimately, this is possible.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### philosophical questions:

- If I stimulate the occipital lobe of a blind person to make them think they are experiencing blinding 
bright light through the eyes, will they be blinded by the stimulation in their mind? Will their mind respond as if
the stimulation was entering through the eyes?
- If the mind is stimulated with data to make it behave as if it were seeing something, will it also perform the action of
remembering something that it sees through mind stimulation without using the eyes? 
- __Answer:__ Yes. You see things in your dreams, right?
You remember some of the things you see while you dream. You remember some of the things you experience while you dream.
- I am I exist, but should have been I exist, therefore, I am (debate rages on) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum
