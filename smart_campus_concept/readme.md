# Smart Campus Concept

*Transforming education using technology - examining the requirements gathering for a smart campus*

A 6-12 grade concept in education that assumes learning will take place in a classroom in a school campus with a principal, assistant-principals, directors of education, teachers, and other personnel present on the campus to provide instruction or assistance. This system assumes remote learning will happen only when there are no other alternatives. However, the system recommends that all learning takes place inside a classroom at a school, and that instruction be provided by a teacher.


More information coming soon! I'm trying to make this one more presentable.
