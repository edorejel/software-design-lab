### no formal research yet, just flushing out requirements as they are thought out

- __possible research focus: analyze the effect of having a 100% paper-free campus,__ that is, how many other tasks are related to
delivering or using paper at a school, what is the complete supply chain of paper from start to end, examine every action that is performed to have paper delivered to a school, examine every action and its impact on the environment, what type of energy is expended to ensure a school never runs out of paper
- __a 100% paper free campus__ also includes paper such as construction paper for art classes
- __eliminate physical education classess__ - some 6-12 campuses do not have physical education classes nor physical education teachers, a (smart) campus should be evaluated to determine if physical education classes can be removed in place of more academic classes
- potential gain in eliminating physical education classes in favor of academic classes, this should be happening at any school that is underperforming or at risk of being labeled an underperforming school, __if students are performing poorly at a campus, the last thing the students should be doing is playing outside in a physical education class__
- __eliminate full time physical education teachers and classes,__ incorporate physical education as an elective that is taught by regular teachers, limit the elective to 1-hour 3 days a week, or 1-hour 2 days a week, or an end-of-day period of instructions, physical education is not necessarily needed as an actual class in some schools, it should be eliminated or replaced, if possible
- physical education classes and teachers can be replaced with __foreign language teachers,__ __engineering teachers,__ __computer science teachers__ or __dance teachers,__ any type of class that would expose students to different types of technologies, cultures or art could replace physical education classes
- __teachers that replace physical education teachers__ should teach a subject that will reinforce the topics that students have the most difficulty with, these topics tend to be science and math related
- __as far as removing physical education classes,__ I'd wager you could make the argument that physical education classes are more of a burden than a benefit for some 6-12 grade schools

### general requirements

- smart campus assumes mobile devices will be used by all personnel and students
- smart campus assumes mobile device usage between parents and students
- smart campus assumes mobile device communication between personnel and parents
- smart campus assumes personnel such as teachers will use software (facetime, skype) to engage with parents or family members of their students
- smart campus assumes personnel will add parents and family to their contacts list for work related issues, after a semester is over, the contacts list will become unavailable to parents and staff, to put this another way, personnel of the smart campus will add parents of students in their class to their own friends list for school related purposes only
- smart campus assumes laptops (or other mobile devices) will be used by all personnel and students
- smart campus assumes a 100% paper-free campus (paper or paper-related items used when required, for example maintenance, janitor, kitchen, restrooms, faculty lounges, napkins)
- smart campus assumes that by eliminating paper usage, paper shipments large in size will not be needed, thus, large trucks to deliver paper to the campus will not be needed, thus, trees to make the paper will not be cut down
- smart campus assumes that by having all books in digital format, there will be a limit as to the number of excuses a student can use to justify why the student has not read a book
- smart campus assumes that personnel will procure digital textbooks for classwork as well as digital books to read for pleasure
- smart campus assumes that personnel will set up digital libraries using websites to display various copies of digital books to their students
- smart campus assumes that personnel will require students and parents to film themselves reading at least one book a month, the student-parent reading video assignments shall be a requirement to pass to the next grade and to pass the semester
- smart campus assumes that by eliminating paper usage for all, but emergency tasks, only required staff can be hired to work inside an office, additional security staff can be hired with resources that are saved from not hiring and maintaining a bloated office staff
- smart campus assumes that by automating or eliminating certain tasks associated with periods of daily instruction, more time can be spent on teaching and learning, (I personally don't understand why schools are still reliant on paper, pens, pencils, and other non-technological materials.)
- schools that are reliant on paper, there are many schools still reliant on paper, appear to be caught in a catch-22 scenario wherein schools preach and advocate so-called "green" policies along with climate change fear-mongering, but schools use paper for many things with the paper having many data points and energy requirements that it must pass through and use to arrive at the school
- data points are locations that the paper must pass through before actually arriving at the school for delivery, energy requirements are forms of the energy that paper requires to achieve delivery, some forms of energy are gas or diesel for trucks that must deliver the paper, electricity required to deliver the paper, human-power to process the delivery 
- an interesting side project related to the smart campus is to reverse engineer a paper delivery route to figure out what data points it must pass through to arrive at a school from the moment a tree is cut down to the moment the paper is delivered to a school
- in the reverse engineering process, it would be ideal to analyze the various forms of energy required and consumed from the moment a tree is cut down, to the moment it becomes paper, to the moment the paper is delivered

- smart campus assumes late student arrivals to be tracked using sensors and an education suite
- smart campus assumes all visitors that are non-student and non-personnel will be tracked immediately when they step inside the campus
- smart campus assumes all visitors shall receive a visitor badge to be directly validated at the main point of entry to the smart campus
- smart campus assumes visitors shall not proceed to visit the main office or classrooms without first being logged in at the main entry point to then receive a temporary visitor ID card
- smart campus assume visitor ID cards will be dispensed at the main entry point via machine or personnel
- smart campus main entry point could be a small kiosk or booth manned by non-office personnel
- smart campus main entry point shall be manned by actual security personnel (not a secretary or office worker holding a walkie-talkie)
- smart campus assumes that by having teachers procure electronic digital copies of books, students will have one less excuse to roam out of their seats
- smart campus assumes that by having teachers shift to all digital assignments, there will be less clutter as well as less excuses to not do assignments
- smart campus assumes that by having all assignments in digital format, students will only exit the classroom when the period is over, to go to the office, to go speak with another teacher, to go to the restroom

### preliminary analysis
- not having a 100% paper-free campus is more of a negative than a positive for many factors
- any money saved by not using paper can be allocated to other areas such as hiring competent staff, for example, hiring 
actual security personnel, instead of giving a walkie-talkie to an office worker (or secretary) to play the role of a security guard
- eliminating paper seems like a problem to thoroughly investigate to arrive at a potential solution 
- the effect could be a net positive for the schools because they could eliminate paper usage while eliminating bloated 
office staff and non-teaching personnel positions, freeing up office space for more classrooms, hiring more teachers, and hiring actual security personnel


### id card requirements

- smart campus assumes smart id cards to be used by personnel and students
- smart campus assumes id cards shall be required while on campus during school semesters and school hours
- smart campus will deactivate all smart id cards when semester is not in session
- smart campus id cards shall be valid for the student's duration at the campus
- smart campus id cards can be digital or traditional cards
- smart campus id cards that are digital shall be carried on student mobile devices

### desk requirements

- smart campus desks shall have built-in touchscreens to cover the entire surface area of the desks
- smart campus desks shall have internet connectivity
- smart campus desks shall function similar to a laptop or other mobile device
- smart campus desks shall be able to interface with student and personnel mobile devices
- smart campus desks shall allow students to submit assignments to the education suite for grading
- smart campus desks shall allow students to take tests to then submit to the education suite for grading
- smart campus desks shall allow students to view lessons on the built-in touchscreen
- smart campus desks shall alert when a student is not in their seat for any reason
- smart campus desks shall be calibrated to a student's ID card for security and anti-cheat measures, if the id card is not swipped, the smart desk is inoperable unless security measures overriden by personnel
- smart campus desks shall have sensors to indicate when a student is seated or not seated at their desk
- - the rationale for this is that some students tend to roam for no good reason, or they leave the classroom for no good reason, or they go to the restroom too much
- - tracking when a student is sitting at their desk will allow a teacher to present the data of their child's behavior while in the classroom in a quantified way
- - this means that teachers will be able to provide hard proof, in the form of data taken from behavior, that their child is constantly out of their seat
- - there could be many reasons for this behavior from the child, so being able to quantify this would be helpful
- - the parent can be notified immediately upon their child being out of their seat or at the end of the day, or at some other time interval
- - essentially, this small tracking ability will give parents the confidence to know that not only is their child in class, but their child also seated
- smart campus desks shall be lightweight individual units
- smart campus desks shall be able to be moved around in the event group work is required
- smart campus desks shall provide charging ability for all mobile and digital devices, these services will be calibrated to the student id card of a particular student, so each desk will have a secure charging station available for the student assigned to that desk only
- smart campus desks will solve the problem of students not having supplies to complete their assignments
- smart campus desks will solve the problem of students losing assignments
