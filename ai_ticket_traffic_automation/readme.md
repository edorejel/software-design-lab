# ai enhanced e-ticket and traffic infraction automated service

This is a hypothetical service. I may code up a simplistic model.

#### software design concept 

> It's 2020 and cops still write tickets? Put all that stuff online, it's just easier that way! This type of system can be done now. I'm not sure why it hasn't been implemented. The goal is to streamline the job of the police officer by automating some of their trivial tasks. Is writing tickets a trivial task? It is.

- goal #1: eliminate paper tickets (save money by eliminating paper)
- goal #2: faster more accurate infraction systems (save time by not writing tickets)
- goal #3: almost guaranteed payment of tickets and infractions (increase state inbound money)
- goal #4: upgrade, upgrade, upgrade
