# Hawk Behavior


Analyze hawk flying behavior for potential uses. Do we really need drones that can fly similar or better than hawks?

Jogging the other day and witnessed a hawk attacking a crow during flight. 
- The crow was flying for its life while calling for help or to warn other crows or to try to scare the hawk away, I assume.
- I was close to this aerial chase, and I tend to analyze animal behavior closely, so I think there could be something for aeria drones in a hawk's flying ability.
- This makes a good software/hardware project.
