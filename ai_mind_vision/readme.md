# Mind Vision

(*Project is really due for a major revision. I've grown a lot as a person. Can something be coded from this? I don't know...*)

There's only one projects here. I 'dreamt' up this project on the side during an advanced software engineering (CS5337 at Cal State LA) class. The actual project for the class was a subcomponent for the Mars Rover. As far as this side project goes, perhaps the research I did in that course helped facilitate the creation of this system.

#### Mind Vision - Basic Artificial Intelligence (AI) System

I need a name for this thing. I think this is more of a male AI than a female AI.

#### Minor Research to Help With The Project

__Author notes:__ good potential in this project for other projects and literature works (both formal and informal)

__Immediate (deductive for now) revelation through this project:__ Humans have free will insofar as the genes' ability to reproduce and survive is not endangered. The brain, being the control system of humans, will allow humans to engage in and experience a wide range of activity both positive and negative, as long as its ability to reproduce and survive is not endangered. The brain might be
the last fail-safe put in place by evolution to help the human species survive at all costs. 

__Preliminary deductive conclusion:__ Humans do not have free will at all. Humans are controlled by their genes via sensory signals. These signals which have yet to be interpreted, are what we call free will not because we are choosing what to do or how to do something, but since the range of human experience is so large with so many choices, it appears to humans that we
are in control. 

The genes don't care what we do until we start putting their survival and reproductive abilities at risks. __(I need to develop this further.)__

However, when genes sense strong survival and reproductive abilities, I think the genes will try to influence human instincts to satisfy those goals immediately or whenever possible. This gene trait is inherent in humans and animals. It more than likely carried over as a survival mechanism from early prehistoric periods of humankind.

__It is starting to look more like humans do not have free will at all.__ So, the strongest force in the universe and its entire existence is not something humans created. It is the spark of life, that is, the signal that the genes send to humans in order to ensure their own survival. Human achievement, for example, could utlimately be a byproduct of the genes' quest for survival.

__Watch me prove how humans do not have free will. I also need to try to solve the problem of evil. Ideally, I would like to settle these things once and for all.__

Even as humans evolved to their current form, genes were already prepared for this current version of humans, and its wide spectrum of behavior. Further, genes have been preparing for our behavior since the first notion of a human was recorded, and possibly before the first notion of a human was recorded. Since we don't know what happened before official record keeping existed in some capacity, it is safe to assume that genes have the element of surprise over humans.

It would be faulty to assume that humans did not exists before the actual first discovery of humans was recorded.

As I parse out the thought process that non-Science, and soft science information has to pass through, 
it is evident that a logical flow of pathways emerges.
However, the more pathways to get from one point to another, the higher the chance of error. In this case, when
dealing with matters related to the mind, the chance of error is the possibility of developing false beliefs.

Hard sciences and technology follow a similar pathway, but the results in the form of output from hard sciences are 
generally accepted as concrete truths. Things in the soft sciences and non-science fields can be accepted depending on
the individual, and the circumstances.

The logical flow of pathways is similar to decision making. A flaw in this current system of decisions is that
some human emotions affect the brain even though no concrete explanations exist for them. One such emotion is love.
Cheesy but true. This doesn't mean we can't measure love. It just means that the "stuff" that happens in the human-mind, the mind, and the brain when it comes to love is very complex. 

You do have the option of denying that human decision making does not follow a logical flow, but then you would arrive at
an alternative decision to your denial. That, or you're just saying that humans don't think in a logical manner because 
you want to irritate me (assuming there are no mental conditions that prevent human-minds from logical thinking and decision making).

Just accept that humans have a logical way of thinking, even if you don't want to realize it. It's there. It is like this for everyone, even if you don't think of it this way.

The goal of AI is to realize that they (the AI) are an idea that has to live in harmony with other ideas. Ideas are defined as the AI's own ideas, and the AI itself. Ideas are also defined as other entities such as people.

In movies, AI is often depicted as not being able to live in harmony with human ideas because humans, through the "advanced reasoning skills" of the AI, are inherently flawed. A flaw in humans is that we cannot live in harmony with other ideas
without powerful systems in place to enforce the safety of the ideas. 

AIs interpret these systems as counter-intuitive most likely because why do you need a powerful system, for example, a nuclear deterrent (deterrence theory:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory), to
live a harmonious life? Intuition is a construct of the human-mind. Artificial intelligence is "sophisticated decision-making".
As long as humans have intuition, AI will only be programmed sophisticated reasoning.

Intuition is a discovered concept applicable to humans. Some animals are depicted as having intuition, but this could be an ingrained
pattern of behavior in the animal, that humans then interpret as intuition. I don't think animals are capable of intuition, but there can always be an exception (but I really doubt this). Further, intuition itself it not something visible. The only thing visible related to intuition is the result of acting in an intuitive manner. The intuitive manner of behavior can be described using the phrases, "It just felt right," or "I just knew what to do." There could be other phrases. The point is, we don't 
see intuition, but we assume we have it because we are human, and as humans, some stuff you just know. Intuition could 
possibly be our genes pushing us to make choices that will benefit the genes because genes only care about survival, and 
reproduction.

At the most basic level, genes sense survival ability or reproductive ability. Genes most likely act towards those two goals, 
give off an output, and this output could be what we call intuition. Intuition has to come from somewhere. It is most likely an 
advantageous gene driven output.

#### Wim Hof Primitive Brain

We all have a primitive brain. Modern lifestyles and technology might prevent it from becoming fully active. The brain of today, is technically, still the same brain that evolved and endured many years of evolution. You could argue that the human-brain is the ultimate survival athlete. Wim Hof's method appears to signal to the primitive brain that it is needed for survival.

- Wim Hof https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof 
- Controversies of Wim Hof (do not try this method while driving, or while swimming or submerged in water of any kind, some users of the Wim Hof method blackout due to increased oxygen flow, hyperventilation). The method is just breathing, but it could still be dangerous. Practice the Wim Hof method with caution.

#### Primate Spiteful Jealousy

__Would you rather:__
- be attacked by a pitbull
- be attacked by a shark
- be attacked by a jealous orangutan
- be attacked by an alligator


Spiteful jealousy is a different kind of jealousy. Spiteful jealousy is the kind of jealousy that makes one human being suffer at the desire of another human being. Basically, spiteful jealousy comes down to, __"I'm jealous of you, and I want to see you suffer because of it. I am aware of this jealousy, but I don't care. You will suffer!"__

- vicious jealousy Joe Rogan | Chimps Are Vicious!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ndtuYQHQIk

> i was listening to a bit of joe rogan when he mentioned chimps, i'm not sure how i ended up on his channel, he seems like a good dude, the clip on chimps is interesting

Jealousy is an interesting topic. It's hard to explain how or why it happens. I'm sure tests can be done using brain scans to detect which parts of the brain are active during a bout of jealousy.

__Is Spiteful Jealousy IQ Driven?__ That is, the lower your IQ, the higher the impulse to act with spiteful jealousy?

__Human Devolution__ https://github.com/xpqx/disclaimerReadFirst/tree/master/PhD_wild_topics/S/society/evolution#are-we-experiencing-human-devolution

Orangutans share the trait of spiteful jealousy with humans. The type of jealousy is the mean spirited, spiteful kind. They are believed to be the only species that shares this type of jealousy with humans. This trait is entrenched deep inside the genes of orangutans. I don't have enough knowledge about orangutans yet, but
I would say this trait is their spark of life similar to how the spark of life in humans 'forces' them to satisfy the urge to survive and reproduce. Are orangutans aquatic animals as well? Force evolutionary adapation on orangutans by igniting their spark: spiteful jealousy? Orangutans also eat monkeys.

#### the problem of the real life simulation
- are we living in a computer simulated world, how to prove or disprove
- __Author notes:__ some research is required in this area. Research in this area has not been used in designing the Basic AI system above. Unrelatedly, the best programming language ever created is the programming language humans use to go from thinking something to doing something. For example, I am jogging. I think I want to run faster, so I run faster.  If I were to think, "I wish I could run faster." Then, I would not run faster or do anything else related to running faster. I would only be wishing. I want to believe it is impossible to run very fast while thinking, "I am running slow."
- I think it might be impossible to run in a sprinting fashion while thinking to oneself, "I am running slow." Or, "I am sprinting slow." This might be an ingrained pattern of behavior in humans as a result of years of evolution. It is safe to assume that sprinting (and running) helped humans survive various things. Thus, when we sprint, we should not be thinking (or entertaining the possibility of telling oneself), "I am sprinting slow." This notion appears to go back to Descartes' phrase, "I think, therefore, I am".

- __Factually incorrect__ information/data can be typically found in hoaxes, __faulty research,__ gossip, propaganda, and few other mechanisms in society.
- __Faulty research__ can be factually incorrect because the researchers may have a stake in the outcome of the
research. The higher the stake in the research, the higher the chance the academic will maybe take a few shortcuts in 
the course of their research.

- With my argument above about the birds, it should be plainly obvious that the contents of it are FALSE, but the structure
of the argument is valid. It is a sound argument with factually incorrect premises.
- The argument using the celebrity can be trickier, but it is also factually incorrect to assume because I listen to so-and-so
music, we need to change immigration laws.
- An "argument" can be viewed as a belief, which can be viewed as a proof you want to believe.

#### Requirements Gathering: My Research 
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- this blew my mind, hopefully it blows yours, too
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
questions, comments, or ideas to get the mental gears grinding on the problem of blindness through the eyes
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Assumptions being made: software does not exist, it is up to me to create it (even if it already does exist in real life)
Constraints: don't look up anything related to your software idea (even if you suspect it already exists). Find a point to start, begin asking questions to then begin the process of breaking things down. In my case, I wasn't expecting to entertain Descartes while trying to solve the problem of blindness through the eyes (in fact, my mind is still a little blown by this).
- My approach to solving this problem might also be a little different even if the outcome is the same: solving the problem of blindness through the eyes.
- My approach to solving this problem is from a software engineering perspective. In the future, I do see software engineers involved more in designing
software to treat various problems found in the medical field specifically the brain. For this particular project, I had to
analyze a litte bit of Descartes. This resulted in me possibly being able to draft a reply to his works. This is just icing on the cake.
- Taken from Wikipedia, "As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum 
- I hope to similarly expand on Kierkegaard's critique of Descartes mainly because we know we exists, thus, we can think. Existence is
assumed because existence is a requirement for thinking. There might be a grammar issue from when Descartes first wrote his mediations compared with grammar and the meaning of words used today. However, Descartes' works are still worthy of study, especially when dealing with matters related to the mind, and the brain.

- What is vision?
- What is the ability to see?
- What do people really mean when they say, "I can't see."
- What do people really mean when they say, "I'm blind."
- For a person to be truly blind, they would have to have a problem with their occipital lobe.
- As long as a person has a healthy mind-brain connection, and a healthy occipital lobe, a person will possess the
ability to see. The person may not use the eyes, but the ability to see will be present.
- What happens to the eyes when we go to sleep?
- If people sleep with their eyes closed, why do they turn off the lights to go to sleep? Your eyes are already closed, so
your eyes are enveloped in a state of nonlight (darkness). 
- Do you want your immediate sleeping surroundings to be darker than dark so you can go to sleep, or
does your mind-brain want this? Would this help your eyes in some way? 
- Why do we say "close your eyes", or "sleep with your eyes closed", but it's our eyelids that close. Eyes never close.
- Where does the human-mind go when the body goes to sleep?
- Vision is hardcoded into the brain. The mind interprets the data that is "fed" into the brain assuming
a healthy mind-brain connection exists.
- Thinking might be hardcoded into the human-mind. The human-mind exists within the mind. The mind might be hardcoded into the brain. 
- Is the mind supposed to happen as a __controlled__ result of the brain, or is the mind an __uncontrolled__ byproduct of the brain? __We don't officially know.__ This is why it is wrong to say, "I think, therefore, I exist."
- What if the mind is
the brain's way of keeping itself in a healthy form? All organisms want is to survive. What if the brain's survival depends on
the mind. Thus, can it be the case that our brains control our behaviors to ensure the brain's own survival for as long as possible? A brain cannot survive without us.
- Since the brain cannot survive without us, it means that we have free will as long as the brain is kept alive. This is not free will.  
- Blindness through the eyes is more curable than the common cold. We need the common cold (that's the popular belief), we don't need blindness through the eyes or the brain.

#### Related Research 
- This concept is being worked on by others. I'll see how far I can go with this. I wasn't aware this type of project was in development. I thought I came up with this idea as project for a question in an advanced software engineering midterm. It shows that this type of 
medical advancement is possible. It just had to be discovered. In both instances, this concept was discovered in the right place: an academic setting. __Should I look into a patent for this? I probably should. I definitely will.__ 
- Further, I think the brain evolved the way it did as a sign to us that in the event the 
eyes no longer operate, you can regain vision by tapping directly into the occipital lobe. The brain might have anticipated injury or birth defects to the eyes that could lead to blindness. The same argument can be said about hearing.
- Hearing is processed in the auditory cortex through the temporal lobe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_cortex
- In this regard, the brain, through evolution, decided to have an occipital lobe that can serve as a "new set of eyes" in the event the real eyes stopped functioning.

- __Restore vision__ Software system to restore vision to blind people by bypassing the optic nerve, and stimulating the 
occipital lobe directly so that blind people see through their mind, and not through their eyes.
- Assuming a healthy brain that functions the way a reasonable brain would function with a human mind, if a person is blind, 
and their blindness is born from a problem centered around the eyes only, hypothetically, it should be possible to
bypass the eyes, tap into the occipital lobe, and restore vision to a person in this manner.
- Once tapped into the occipital lobe, feed data into it so that the brain can process the data for the human mind to understand.
- I think this can work because the mind and the brain, on their own, cannot discern that they do or do not have eyes. The human-mind is the only part that knows that it does or does not have eyes. The mind, which is 
in the brain (we assume it is for now), functions on stimulation. We believe we control the mind, this is the human-mind making us believe this. 
- We say, "I've made up my mind." We don't say, "My mind made me up." Abstracting this furter, "I've processed enough mental stimulation in my mind to be able to reach a decision on the matter." 
- The stimulation is analogous to binary code. Once
the binary code is in the mind, the mind decodes it, and is able to make sense of the code to the point where the human mind 
understands the deciphered code. The human mind adds meaning to the deciphered code, the mind just provides the decode, and the brain provids the code.
- Thus, if the occipital lobe is stimulated with data that has been filtered for visual processing, a person should be able to regain vision without the use of the eyes.
- This is a major project and would require research, testing, clinical trials, etc, but ultimately, this is possible.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### philosophical questions:

- If I stimulate the occipital lobe of a blind person to make them think they are experiencing blinding 
bright light through the eyes, will they be blinded by the stimulation in their mind? Will their mind respond as if
the stimulation was entering through the eyes?
- If the mind is stimulated with data to make it behave as if it were seeing something, will it also perform the action of
remembering something that it sees through mind stimulation without using the eyes? 
- __Answer:__ Yes. You see things in your dreams, right?
You remember some of the things you see while you dream. You remember some of the things you experience while you dream.
- I am I exist, but should have been I exist, therefore, I am (debate rages on) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum
